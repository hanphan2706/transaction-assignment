# TransactionAssignment

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Changes of bb-ui components 

Removed data-test-hook in transaction-item-component.html.
Honestly, I have no idea what they are used for. Perhaps, it is a new way to get select from ng-content.


## Notes

I'm very sorry for making some changes to the UI components. Please give me feedback as well as explanations, they will be a huge lesson for me.

Thank you guys for the assignment. Hope we have a change for discussing more about it.
